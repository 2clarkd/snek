.SH NAME
snekde \- Snek Development Environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "snekde" [OPTION]...
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\--port <serial port>
Specifies the serial port to use to communicate with the target device.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I snekde
is an integrated development environment for Snek on embedded
computers. It runs in a terminal and displays two panes. The upper
pane is the editor pane and is designed to edit Snek source code. The
lower pan is the interaction pane and displays output from the target
device and sends commands to the target device.
.SH KEY BINDINGS
.I snekde
is entirely keyboard operated; it does not use the mouse at all. For
the most part, both panes accept the same commands. Normal characters
are inserted into the current pane.
.TP
Page-Up/Page-Down
These change the current pane, moving from edit pane to interaction
pane and back.
.TP
Ctrl-X/Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V
These are the bindings for Cut/Copy/Paste operations.
.TP
Ctrl-C
In the interaction pane, Ctrl-C does not copy text, instead it
interrupts execution in the target device.
.TP
Function keys
The function keys F1-F6 perform various global operations. These
operations are displayed at the top of the screen. F1 selects a new
target device. F2/F3 get and put the contents of the edit pane to the
target device program storage. F5/F6 load and save the edit pane
contents to files on the local computer.
.TP
Movement
The usual cursor keys, along with Home and End move the cursor within
the current pane.
