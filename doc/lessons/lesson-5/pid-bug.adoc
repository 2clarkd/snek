== Advanced Topics: PID controller

The version of the line bug shown above is sometimes called a
“bang-bang” robot as it turns the motors either on or off as it
wiggles back and forth across the edge of the line. We can do better
than that by using a more advanced algorithm called a
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.
