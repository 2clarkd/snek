.TH SNEK-@UBOARD@-INSTALL 1 "snek-@BOARD@-install" ""
.SH NAME
snek-@BOARD@-big-install \- Install larger version of Snek to
Arduino ATmega328 board
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "snek-@BOARD@-install" [OPTION]... [COMMAND]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I snek-@BOARD@-install
installs the larger version Snek programming language on an Arduino
board with an ATmega328, overwriting the boot loader. This
version of snek provides support for a few extra
functions, 'input', 'float' and 'int'. As a consequence, it does not
leave room for the Optiboot loader and must be flashed using a
separate programmer dongle.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-isp <ISP model>
Specifies the programmer to use, common options are 'usbtiny'
and 'avrisp2'. The default is 'usbtiny'.
.TP
\-hex <snek.hex>
Specifies the hex file to load to the board. The default is the
currently installed version of Snek.
.TP
\-mcu <MCU name>
Specifies which micro controller to expect to find on the board. Some
boards have m328 while others have m328p. The default is @MCU@, but if
you get an error message indicating a mismatch, you can try the other.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
fuseload
Sets the target fuse bits for Snek usage and then loads Snek to the
device. This is the default command
.TP
load
Loads Snek to the device without first setting the fuse bits. Snek
will not work correctly if the fuse bits are not set correctly, so
only do this if the target has already had the fuse bits set correctly.
.TP
fuse
Sets the target fuse bits suitable for Snek usage. You must do this
before Snek will work on the target device, although you may do it
before or after loading the Snek system. You only need to do this once
per board.
