board, including the ability to re-program the ATmega16u2 chip used as
a usbserial converter.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-port <port>
Specifies the serial port to use when programning the ATmega2560 chip,
the default is '/dev/ttyACM0'.
.TP
\-isp <ISP model>

and 'avrisp2'. The default is 'usbtiny'.
.TP
\-hex <snek.hex>
Specifies the hex file to load to the board. The default is the
currently installed version of Snek when programming the ATmega2560, and the
currently installed version of the usbserial program when programming
the ATmega16u2.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
snek
Loads  Snek to the target device. This is the default command. Note
that snekde will not be able to get/put programs to the device without
also reprogramming the ATmega16u2 device used as a usb to serial
converter on the Arduino Mega board.
.TP
usbserial
Loads the updated usbserial converter firmware to the ATmega16u2
device on the Arduino Mega board. This version supports the XON/XOFF
flow control required for SnekDE to be able to successfully
