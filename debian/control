Description: Embedded system programming language
 Snek is a small python-like language designed for embedded
 computers. It can run on systems as small as an Arduino Duemilanove
 board, which is an ATmega 328 processor with 32kB of flash and 2kB of
 ram. This package includes a binary for that target, the
 snek-duino-install tool for installing Snek on Arduino boards, the
 snekde integrated development environment

Description: Host binary version of Snek programming language
 Snek is a small python-like language designed for embedded
 computers. It can run on systems as small as an Arduino Duemilanove
 board, which is an ATmega 328 processor with 32kB of flash and 2kB of
 ram. This package provides a host snek binary for playing with the
 language on your host machine.
